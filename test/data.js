Front-end programmers at F.biz work initially in a guideline, similar to Twitter Bootstrap’s documentation. Each module HTML/CSS/JS is built separately, using Sass, and then integrated in a single page using high standards of organization and agile methodology. A great part of the front-end of the sports e-commerce Netshoes was developed by the agency. I have also worked to brands as Unilever, Subaru, Zattini, Toddynho, Multiplus, Claro, NET and Instituto Maria da Penha.

Built using very recent technologies at the time, as Twitter Bootstrap, Backbone.js, Node.js and Redis as a database, and focusing on performance, comparacaodefundos.com is the pioneer webapp for investment funds search in Brazil. Its architecture based on thick client makes it much faster than any (generally obsolete) national financial software. The webapp was famous in its market and very complimented by its performance.
